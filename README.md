# sitemap

This repo shows how you can use the `get-sitemap-links` npm package and use it to return an array of the URL's of a site. The backend code can be found in the `node.js` file.

In the `front-end.js` file is JavaScript to run on the front end which populates select fields on a form and transforms the URL to give a human readable option.

You could sync the page list to any backend database instead of doing this work on the front-end.

The `style.css` file is just for a Select 2 example.
